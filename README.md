# Multimodal-Vision-Language-Model-Implementation
A complete from-scratch implementation of Google's PaliGemma multimodal vision-language model that combines SigLIP vision encoding with Gemma language modeling for advanced image understanding and text generation. This educational implementation provides the full model architecture including the vision transformer encoder, causal language decoder, multimodal projection layers, and efficient inference with KV caching. The project features automatic device detection (CUDA/MPS/CPU), configurable generation parameters, and a clean CLI interface for running visual question answering, image captioning, and other vision-language tasks. Designed for learning and research purposes, it demonstrates how to build and deploy state-of-the-art multimodal AI systems from the ground up while maintaining production-ready code quality and comprehensive documentation.

**Key Features**: 
 - Complete model architecture
 - Efficient KV caching
 - Flexible sampling strategies
 - Automatic device optimization
 - Easy-to-use CLI interface
 - Comprehensive preprocessing
